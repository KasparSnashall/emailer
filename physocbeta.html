           Hello this is my first beta test of a html email system, that I have learnt how to make during my summer internship. My name is Kaspar Im not sure who will recieve this but I am faily sure you know me as I regulary attend the Physoc talks. I am sending this to you today as I would like to enable you to have this system. Its absolutely <b>free</b> and I am making it for experience and also to increase the popularity of Physoc,physics and science in general. I would also like to make one for mathsoc with the same sort of design.
          </p>

          				This sytem runs on open source software in the python langauge its very easy to use and will allow valuable experience in python which is fast becoming a popular language. It uses several python modules such as beautiful soup 4 all installed on a virtual environment using pip. If you have a linux or mac this sytem is simple to set up. It isnt so nice with windows so I would recommend installing linux Ubuntu along side it.
                  I will be more then willing to sit down with thee secretery to show them how to use it and set it up.

                <p style="font-family:arial;color:white;font-size:15px;text-align:left;padding:5px;"> If you know a bit of python then its simple a background in html is also useful but if not it takes about 1 to 2 hours to become an expert in it. Hence you can create lovely emails which will increase the popularity of our society no end. Not to mention you can put up your adverts for talks here.
                It will also allow you to put up links to scientific articles and other media very easily which I would love to see more of in the society.</p>

                  If you do use my system I would like to see more poeple writing some small articles on things theyve heard or read, I would love to get anybody that writes a blog to write something up for this. I dont want this to be just a thing that the secretery does alone if you could get some more people like myself we can each add a bit to this and really make this a great email. Not only that but we can also do some forms and things like that to get people input on the email. I would also like a suggestions column for things in the society I have a few myself such as organising a day were people can give 5-10 min presentations on a subject that interests them.
